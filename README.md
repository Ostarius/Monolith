Monolith
========

VERY IMPORTANT: 
 VIEW THIS FILE AS 'RAW' BECAUSE GITHUB IS RETARDED AND DOESNT SHOW THE FORMATTING ON NORMAL MODE. I'LL FIGURE IT OUT LATER JUST READ THE DAMN THING. 


Mission statement:
  The purpose of this project is to develop an efficient form of categorization and recording of a given environment, in 
  relation to basic psychological principles, which will affect further means of classification. Once this has been 
  developed, it may then be expanded for interaction with the given environment, to supply for its own wants and needs. 

Execution:
  The project shall be developed in several stages and phases, as follows:
    1.0 self.py
      - Categories 
          As the psychology shall be not implemented within the categories, and as the categories shall expand over time,
          the categories will be numbered from 1-x, for the sake of simplicity and growth. The base number of categories
          shall be 6.0
      - Nature
          The nature of Monolith shall be user-defined, as the user will prioritize which cateogires are more favoured to be 
          filled than others. The basic nature of Monolith shall be an even distribution of categories. As Monolith goes
          through the environment, it will do its best to fill the lacking categories when it can. User-defined nature will
          give a certain desire to Monolith, filling certain categories as a priority.
    2.0 enviro.py
      - Thoughts
          The environment shall consist of many 'thoughts'. Each thought shall be a numeric string, defining what   categories 
          and the ratio of which it belongs to. These thoughts are randomly-generated and Monolith shall categorize them 
          according to their numeric string. 
      - Objects 
          An object shall be an array of thoughts or smaller objects, and Monolith shall categorize the object as a whole,
          according to the ratios of categories in the strings contained in the object. 
      - Relations
          Certain objects or thoughts shall be marked similar by Monolith and will be treated with similar nature. This 
          may either be randomly defined, dynamically defined or user-defined. 
    3.0 tools.py      YET TO BE DOCUMENTED 
                      Various tools for data recording and analysis
    4.0 selfnat.py    YET TO BE DOCUMENTED
                      Self-defining and dynamic nature, either random or according to category ratio
    5.0 envint.py     YET TO BE DOCUMENTED
                      Interacting and modidying the environment
    6.0 multi.py      YET TO BE DOCUMENTED
                      Running multiple instances of Monoliths or environment at the same time. 
    7.0 prop.py       YET TO BE DOCUMENTED
